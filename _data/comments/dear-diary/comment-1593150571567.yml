message: "First of all I want to say fantastic blog! I \r\nhad a quick question in which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear \r\nyour mind before writing. I've had a difficult \r\ntime clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \r\nminutes are usually wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions \r\nor tips? Many thanks!"
