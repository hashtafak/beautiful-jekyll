message: "First off I want to say wonderful blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask \r\nif you do not mind. I was curious to find out how you center \r\nyourself and clear your mind before writing. I've had a tough \r\ntime clearing my mind in getting my ideas out. I do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or hints?\r\nThanks! cheap flights y2yxvvfw"
