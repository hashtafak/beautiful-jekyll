message: "I think everything posted made a ton of sense.\r\nHowever, consider this, suppose you composed a catchier \r\ntitle? I ain't suggesting your content is \r\nnot good., but suppose you added something to maybe \r\nget people's attention? I mean Pirates arrrr is kinda vanilla.\r\nYou ought to peek at Yahoo's home page and see how they create news titles to get viewers \r\nto click. You might try adding a video or a pic or two to grab readers excited about what you've \r\nwritten. In my opinion, it could bring your posts a little livelier."
