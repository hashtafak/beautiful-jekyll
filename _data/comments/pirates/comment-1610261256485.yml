message: "Hey this is kinda of off topic but I was wanting to know if blogs use WYSIWYG editors or if you have to \r\nmanually code with HTML. I'm starting a blog soon but have \r\nno coding skills so I wanted to get guidance \r\nfrom someone with experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
