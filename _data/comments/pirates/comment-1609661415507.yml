message: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to swap to coolness learning. why is community service important to you essay <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>web site</a> what the best essay writing service. \r\nBut what is happening today can be called an special delivery of content to listeners in isolation . A lot of varsities  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the move to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never used remote video services to participate in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut  teachers are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its unique methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Thus, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSometimes it is funny. Colleagues from regional varsities said that some teachers asked to write summary by hand and send them scans for verification.Today, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten summary and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education educator asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. Although remote physical excercises can be more originative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity educators are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone educate on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, some of them only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some educators record lessons on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>argumentative thesis statements</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is built on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
