message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \r\n\"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was \r\na hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to \r\ngo back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I had \r\nto tell someone!"
