message: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a \r\nsea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" \r\nShe placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a \r\nhermit crab inside and it pinched her ear. She never \r\nwants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell \r\nsomeone!"
