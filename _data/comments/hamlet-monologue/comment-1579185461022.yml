message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside \r\nand it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
