message: "First of all I would like to say superb blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to \r\nask if you do not mind. I was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your head \r\nbefore writing. I have had a hard time clearing my thoughts in getting my \r\nthoughts out there. I do take pleasure in writing \r\nhowever it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are usually lost simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any ideas or hints?\r\nThanks!"
