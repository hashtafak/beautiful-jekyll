message: "I think that everything said made a lot of sense. But, \r\nwhat about this? suppose you were to create a killer post title?\r\nI mean, I don't want to tell you how to run your website, \r\nbut suppose you added something that makes people desire more?\r\nI mean To be is kinda boring. You ought to glance at Yahoo's \r\nfront page and note how they create post titles to get people to click.\r\nYou might add a related video or a pic or two to grab readers interested about what you've got to say.\r\nJust my opinion, it would bring your blog a little bit \r\nmore interesting."
