I ain't saying your content isn't solid., \r\nbut suppose you added a headline that makes people want more?\r\nI mean To be is kinda plain. You should look at Yahoo's home page and watch how they write post \r\nheadlines to grab people to click. You might add a video or a related pic or two to grab readers interested about everything've got \r\nto say. Just my opinion, it could make your blog a little livelier."
