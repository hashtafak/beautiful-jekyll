message: "First of all I would like to say great blog! I had a quick \r\nquestion that I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear \r\nyour mind prior to writing. I have had a hard time clearing my thoughts in getting \r\nmy thoughts out there. I truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes \r\ntend to be wasted just trying to figure out how to begin. Any ideas or hints?\r\nThanks!"
