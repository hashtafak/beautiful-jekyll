message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave \r\nit to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to her ear and \r\nscreamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!"
