message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell \r\nand gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to \r\nher ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\n\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely \r\noff topic but I had to tell someone!"
