message: "First of all I would like to say great blog!\r\n\r\nI had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was curious to know how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing.\r\nI've had trouble clearing my mind in getting my thoughts out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are generally lost simply just \r\ntrying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or hints?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
