message: "I believe what you posted made a bunch of sense.\r\nBut, what about this? suppose you wrote a catchier \r\npost title? I ain't saying your content is not good., however what if you added a post \r\ntitle that grabbed people's attention? I mean To be is a little boring.\r\nYou might glance at Yahoo's home page and watch how they write article titles to grab viewers to click.\r\nYou might add a related video or a related pic or \r\ntwo to grab readers excited about everything've written. Just my opinion, \r\nit could make your posts a little bit more interesting."
