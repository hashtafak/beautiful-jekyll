message: "Hey there just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The text in your post seem \r\nto be running off the screen in Ie. I'm not sure if this is a formatting \r\nissue or something to do with browser compatibility but \r\nI figured I'd post to let you know. The design look great though!\r\nHope you get the issue solved soon. Thanks"
