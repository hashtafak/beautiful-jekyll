message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 \r\nyear old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear \r\nand screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I \r\nhad to tell someone!"
