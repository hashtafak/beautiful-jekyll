message: "First off I would like to say terrific blog! I had a quick \r\nquestion which I'd like to ask if you don't mind. I was interested \r\nto know how you center yourself and clear your head prior to writing.\r\nI have had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 \r\nto 15 minutes tend to be lost simply just trying to figure \r\nout how to begin. Any ideas or hints? Kudos!"
