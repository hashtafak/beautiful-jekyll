message: "First off I want to say fantastic blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was interested to know how you center yourself and clear your thoughts prior to writing.\r\nI've had trouble clearing my mind in getting my ideas out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to be wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any ideas or hints?\r\nKudos!"
