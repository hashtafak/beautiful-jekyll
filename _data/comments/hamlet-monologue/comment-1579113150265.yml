message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids.\r\nI found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter \r\nand said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit \r\ncrab inside and it pinched her ear. She never wants \r\nto go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
