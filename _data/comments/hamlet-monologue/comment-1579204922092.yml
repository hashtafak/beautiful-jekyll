message: "First of all I would like to say wonderful \r\nblog! I had a quick question in which I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your \r\nthoughts prior to writing. I've had a tough time clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend \r\nto be wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any recommendations or hints?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
