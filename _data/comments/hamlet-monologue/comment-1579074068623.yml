message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my children. I found a sea shell \r\nand gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put \r\nthe shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside \r\nand it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I \r\nknow this is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
