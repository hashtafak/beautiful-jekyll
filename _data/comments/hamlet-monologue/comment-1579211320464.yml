message: "First off I would like to say great blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask \r\nif you don't mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your thoughts prior to \r\nwriting. I've had a hard time clearing my mind in getting my ideas out.\r\n\r\nI truly do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \r\nminutes are wasted just trying to figure out how to \r\nbegin. Any suggestions or tips? Thanks!"
