message: "First off I would like to say awesome blog! I had a quick \r\nquestion that I'd like to ask if you don't mind.\r\nI was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your head before \r\nwriting. I've had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my \r\nideas out there. I do take pleasure in writing however it just seems like the \r\nfirst 10 to 15 minutes are generally lost simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions \r\nor hints? Many thanks!"
