message: "With havin so much content and articles do you ever run into any issues of plagorism or copyright violation? My \r\nsite has a lot of unique content I've either created myself \r\nor outsourced but it looks like a lot of it is popping \r\nit up all over the internet without my permission. Do you know any methods to help reduce content from being ripped off?\r\nI'd truly appreciate it."
