message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids.\r\nI found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She \r\nput the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and \r\nit pinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
