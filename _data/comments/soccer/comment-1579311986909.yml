message: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a sea shell and \r\ngave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\n\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic \r\nbut I had to tell someone!"
