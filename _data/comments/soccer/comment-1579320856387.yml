message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to \r\nmy 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" \r\nShe placed the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab \r\ninside and it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is entirely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
