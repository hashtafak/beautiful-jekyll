message: "First of all I want to say fantastic blog! I had a quick question that I'd like to \r\nask if you don't mind. I was curious to find out how you \r\ncenter yourself and clear your head before writing.\r\nI've had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out.\r\nI truly do enjoy writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are generally wasted just trying \r\nto figure out how to begin. Any ideas or tips?\r\nCheers!"
