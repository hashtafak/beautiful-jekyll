I ain't suggesting your content isn't good, but what if \r\nyou added a title that makes people desire more?\r\nI mean Soccer is a little vanilla. You should peek at Yahoo's home page and watch how \r\nthey write post headlines to get people to open the links.\r\nYou might add a video or a picture or two to grab readers interested about what you've \r\ngot to say. In my opinion, it would bring \r\nyour posts a little bit more interesting."
