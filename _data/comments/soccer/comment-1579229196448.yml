message: "First of all I want to say fantastic blog! I had a quick question in which I'd like to ask if you \r\ndo not mind. I was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear \r\nyour thoughts before writing. I have had a hard time clearing my mind in getting my \r\nthoughts out. I do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \r\nminutes are generally wasted simply just trying to figure out how to begin. Any suggestions or \r\nhints? Appreciate it!"
