message: "Today, I went to the beachfront with my kids. I found a sea \r\nshell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \r\n\"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell to \r\nher ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside \r\nand it pinched her ear. She never wants to go back!\r\nLoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
