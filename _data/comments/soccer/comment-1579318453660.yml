message: "First off I want to say great blog! I had a quick question which I'd like to ask if you do not mind.\r\nI was curious to find out how you center yourself and clear your mind before writing.\r\n\r\nI have had difficulty clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts \r\nout. I truly do take pleasure in writing but it just seems like the \r\nfirst 10 to 15 minutes tend to be lost simply just trying to figure \r\nout how to begin. Any ideas or hints? Kudos!"
