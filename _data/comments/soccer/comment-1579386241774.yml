message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave \r\nit to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the shell \r\nto her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely \r\noff topic but I had to tell someone!"
