message: "Today, I went to the beach with my children. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She placed the \r\nshell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it \r\npinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off topic but I had to tell \r\nsomeone!"
