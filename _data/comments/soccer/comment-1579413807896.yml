message: "My developer is trying to convince me to move to .net from PHP.\r\nI have always disliked the idea because of the costs.\r\nBut he's tryiong none the less. I've been using Movable-type on various websites for about a year and am nervous about switching \r\nto another platform. I have heard very good things about blogengine.net.\r\nIs there a way I can import all my wordpress content into it?\r\n\r\nAny kind of help would be greatly appreciated!"
