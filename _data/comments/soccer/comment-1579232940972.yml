message: "First off I would like to say great blog! I had a quick question in which I'd like to ask \r\nif you do not mind. I was interested to find out how you center yourself \r\nand clear your head before writing. I've had difficulty \r\nclearing my mind in getting my thoughts out. I do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 \r\nminutes are usually wasted just trying to figure out \r\nhow to begin. Any suggestions or tips? Many \r\nthanks!"
