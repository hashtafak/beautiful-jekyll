message: "Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave \r\nit to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and \r\nscreamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it \r\npinched her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this \r\nis totally off topic but I had to tell someone!"
