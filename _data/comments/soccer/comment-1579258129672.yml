message: "I think that what you posted made a bunch of sense. However, what about \r\nthis? suppose you added a little information? I ain't saying your information isn't \r\ngood., however what if you added something to possibly grab people's attention? I mean Soccer \r\nis kinda plain. You should glance at Yahoo's home page and watch \r\nhow they create news titles to get people to open the links.\r\nYou might add a video or a picture or two to grab readers excited about what you've got to \r\nsay. Just my opinion, it might make your posts a little bit more interesting."
