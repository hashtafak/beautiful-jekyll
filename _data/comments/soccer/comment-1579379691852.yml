message: "First off I want to say great blog! I had a quick \r\nquestion which I'd like to ask if you do not mind.\r\n\r\nI was interested to find out how you center yourself and clear your \r\nhead before writing. I've had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my ideas out there.\r\nI do enjoy writing but it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes tend to be wasted simply just trying to figure out \r\nhow to begin. Any ideas or tips? Cheers!"
