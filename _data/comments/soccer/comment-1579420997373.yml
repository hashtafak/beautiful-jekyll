message: "After I originally left a comment I seem to have clicked on the -Notify me when new \r\ncomments are added- checkbox and now each time a comment is added I recieve 4 emails with the same \r\ncomment. Perhaps there is an easy method you can remove me from that service?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"
