message: "My developer is trying to persuade me to move to .net from PHP.\r\nI have always disliked the idea because of the expenses.\r\nBut he's tryiong none the less. I've been using Movable-type on several websites for about a year and am anxious about switching to another \r\nplatform. I have heard fantastic things about blogengine.net.\r\nIs there a way I can import all my wordpress posts into it?\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!"
