message: "Heya this is kind of of off topic but I was wanting to know if blogs use \r\nWYSIWYG editors or if you have to manually code with HTML.\r\nI'm starting a blog soon but have no coding skills so I \r\nwanted to get advice from someone with experience.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!"
